About

"SE chat bot app 3" is supposed to be simpler and better than "SE chat bot project 2"

Main points:
− Actually load and unload modules at runtime, allowing for changes without shutting down the bot
− Less unused code
− more straightforward call stack
− allow to build modules while the app is running

Core package:
− ChatApi
− Runtime module loader
− Incoming message queue (Brain processes them)

Modules:
− Brain (core logic that calls other modules)
− All other modules controlled by Brain module

Planned

additional:
− activity graph? (timeline?)


ChatApi: Announce when (dis)connecting to chat in the debug room.
also when updating modules


restore "edit own message if command message was edited" functionality
− commandResponseMessageIDsDic

tray notification when:
− bad things happen (connection lost)
− user mentioned
− bot mentioned

configurize all paths

add/remove entries by their ID number, keep entries, don't delete them, unless deleted by a force-deletion command, which is just a -f flag after it. Also delete ranges, like 1200-1299 in case some spammer fucked it up

// bot
− unload/load modules (make sure it works)
− check if updates work − how to update? − press button on the form, search for *.dll in compiled module folders, copy over to working dir, instantiate IModules, start
// this will probably be unused forever
